Short Biography
======
I received the B.Sc. Degree (cum laude) in Electronics Engineering from the Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ), Ecuador, in 2016, the dual M.Sc. degree (GPA: 4.0/4.0) in Nanoelectronics and Electronics from USFQ and University of Calabria (UNICAL), Italy, in 2018, and the Ph.D. degree in Electronics Engineering from UNICAL, in 2022. The same year, I won a highly competitive research fellowship funded by the Italian Ministry for Universities and Research (MUR), under the call “Horizon Europe 2021-2027 Programme”. **I am currently a research fellow with the Department of Computer Engineering, Modeling, Electronics, and Systems Engineering (DIMES), UNICAL.** 

In 2019-2020 I was a visiting Ph.D student at EnICS laboratories, BIU, Israel. In Jul-Sep 2022 and Jul-Aug 2023, I was a visiting researcher at EnICS labs.

I was IEEE graduate student member from 2016, and became IEEE member from 2022. I also have authored/coauthored more than 40 scientific papers in international peer-reviewed journals and conferences, and has participated in several IC tapeouts. My research interests include domain-specific hardware accelerators, electronics/spintronics, cryogenic memories, and standard and emerging technologies for logic & memory, and low-power applications. He has received several awards, research grants, and funding. Moreover, I also have been part of several IEEE conference committees, journal boards (review editor of Frontiers in Electronics and Frontiers in Aerospace Engineering), and have been an active reviewer of several journals (IEEE and Elsevier) and conferences (only IEEE).
